### Welcome 👋

👋 Hi! I'm a Ph.D. chemist with 7+ years of experience in computational chemistry, quantum chemistry software, and machine learning—spanning both academia and industry.

🔬 I specialize in developing production-grade scientific software and applying data-driven modeling to problems in chemistry and biotech. I’ve delivered multiple R&D projects from concept to production in cross-functional environments.

I love coding with python and the numerous possibilities that it provides, but I am also skilled in programming with FORTRAN and using MPI parallel programming for challenging computations. 


📁 Note: Most of my serious work lives behind corporate firewalls—so what's here are side projects, demos, and experiments (fun, but not the whole story!)
