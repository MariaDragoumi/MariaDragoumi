### Welcome 👋

I'm Maria, a Data Scientist with a background in Physics and five years of experience in research on Computational Material Science and Theoretical Quantum Chemistry. I love math and I am always intrigued when a new challenge comes my way. Currently, I am on the hunt for Machine Learning and AI challenges. 

I love coding with python and the numerous possibilities that it provides, but I am also skilled in programming with FORTRAN and using MPI parallel programming for challenging computations.
